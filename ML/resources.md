### **Overfitting and Underfitting**
> ***Overfitting***
- Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying
patterns in the training data but also the noise and details that do
not generalize to unseen data
- **Symptoms**
    - High accuracy on training data
    - Poor performance on validation or test data

**Causes**
- Model is too complex (e.g., too many parameters or layers)
- Insufficient training data
- Training for too many epochs without regularization

**Prevention**
- Use regularization techniques
- Reduce the model's complexity
- Use more training data or data augmentation

> ***Underfitting***
- Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the
underlying patterns in the data

**Symptoms**
- Poor performance on both training and validation/test data
- Model fails to capture the complexity of the data

**Causes**
- Model is too simple
- Insufficient training time
- Features used in the model are not relevant or sufficient

**Prevention**
- Use a more complex model
- Train the model for more epochs
- Provide better or more features to the model
