		- **Initial State**: A 3Ã—3 grid with tiles placed in a random but valid configuration.
		- **Actions**: The blank tile can move left, right, up, or down (if within bounds).
		- **Transition Model**: Moving the blank tile swaps its position with the adjacent tile in the chosen direction.
		- **Goal Test**: The state matches the predefined goal configuration (e.g., tiles arranged in order from 1 to 8 with the blank at the bottom-right).
		- **Path Cost**: Each move has a uniform cost of 1 (total cost = number of moves).


# solve -

all algos => 
- Completeness: does it always find a solution if one exists?
- Time complexity: number of nodes generated
- Space complexity: maximum number of nodes in memory
- Optimality: does it always find a least-cost solution
